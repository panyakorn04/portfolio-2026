# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

# Next.js skills — use them

This repo ships two project skills in `.agents/skills/`. Activate them proactively (no need to ask first) when the work matches:

- **nextjs-code-review** — when reviewing Next.js App Router changes: Server/Client Component boundaries, Server Actions, data fetching, caching, middleware, metadata, API routes. Use before finishing a feature or preparing a PR.
- **nextjs-performance** — when writing or optimizing Next.js code that touches Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS), `next/image`, `next/font`, caching (`unstable_cache`, `revalidateTag`, ISR), Server Components, Suspense streaming, or bundle size.

Load a skill's `references/*.md` files on demand for the specific area you are working on rather than reading everything up front.
